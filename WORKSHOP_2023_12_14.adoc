= Workshop 2023-12-14: Standalone Security


== Step 1

Starting branch `workshop_20231214_0` - not secured application.

Run the application - see, everything is unprotected.

Cookie-based HTTP session is supported - _last visited_ functionality works correctly.


== Step 2

Starting branch `workshop_20231214_1` - security auto-configured by added Spring Boot starter.

Key observations:

* all endpoints and static resource are restricted, from anywhere we are redirected to login form
* `POST` endpoints require CSRF token (see console output)
* `GET` endpoints are accessble for authenticated user without CSRF token, e.g. https://localhost:8443/easygo-web/document/mgmt/details/4

Interesting breakpoints:

* `org.springframework.security.authentication.ProviderManager.authenticate()` and `org.springframework.security.provisioning.InMemoryUserDetailsManager.loadUserByUsername()` - in-memory provider with auto-generated user.
* `org.springframework.security.web.FilterChainProxy.doFilter()` in `this.filterChains` you can notice filters configured by Spring Security


== Step 3

Starting branch `workshop_20231214_2` - pragmatic adjustments to auto-configuration.

We have added `WebSecurity` anotated with `@Configuration`, so we could enable some features:

* custom login form
* disclosure fo _security context_ - make Angular frontend aware of what user is logged-in
* Login/Logout button on frontend
* providing CSRF token to Angular frontend, so that it can make secure `POST` requests

Interesting breakpoints:

* `org.defendev.easygo.web.service.DiscloseSecurityContextService.getSecurityContext()`  - _security context_ is stored per-thread ... how it gets there then?
* let's see `org.springframework.security.core.context.ThreadLocalSecurityContextHolderStrategy.setDeferredContext()`
* `org.springframework.security.web.context.HttpSessionSecurityContextRepository.readSecurityContextFromSession()` - deferred context finally invoked

Additionally:

* breakpoint `org.springframework.security.web.authentication.AnonymousAuthenticationFilter.defaultWithAnonymous()` - a *late* stage of filter chain (being `AnonymousAuthenticationFilter`) the authentication is being "_defaulted with anonymous_", i.e. setting principal to `anonymousUser` if on previous stages of filter chain *neither*
+
** getting authentication from session *nor*
** commencing authentication with username/password
+
was successful


== Step 4

Starting branch `workshop_20231214_3` - SQL user database, access control

* DAO Authentication provider with our implementation of `UserDetailsService` (being `EasygoUserDetailsService`)
* Password encoding
* IAM domain (Robust Authorization aka Access Control)
* Test coverate with Spring Security Test Support

Interesting breakpoints:

* breakpoint `org.springframework.security.authentication.ProviderManager.authenticate()` - note the `EasygoUserDetailsService` (our implementation)
